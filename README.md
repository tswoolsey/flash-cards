A math game to practice grade school level math problems.

I created this program after graduating college in a week in my spare time to help my son practice math
over his summer vacation.  It has addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems with one or two digits.
The next phase is to make it more like a game.  To have it keep track of high scores in each set of options, to have a 
game that is free play, a game that stops after a set number of problems, and a timed game.
The ultimate goal is to keep this game up to date with the math problems he will be learning, including fractions.
